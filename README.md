# twoCollision
Two dimensional collision engine for simple block based collisions.

This simulates simple two dimensional collisions between two objects:

Rectangles: Nonmoving randomly generated objects for collision with balls.
Balls: Moving squares that redirect their speeds depending on where they hit on rectangles.
